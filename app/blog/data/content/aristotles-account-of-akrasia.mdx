## Introduction 

In this essay, I will critically analyse Aristotle’s account of the phenomenon of *akrasia*.

The structure of my analysis will be as follows:

1. I will begin by contextualising Aristotle’s discussion of *akrasia* in Book VII of the *Nicomachean Ethics* as a dialectical inquiry seeking to resolve puzzles (*aporiai*) that an attempted synthesis between various reputable opinions gives rise to.

2. I will then provide an overview of the phenomenon of *akrasia* as it is initially presented by Aristotle in Book VII, Chapter 1 of the *Nicomachean Ethics*.

3. I will then provide a summary of the Platonic account of *akrasia*, namely, as an internal conflict within the *akratic* agent’s soul in which the appetite overpowers reason. I will argue that this account gives rise to a puzzle (*aporiai*), as it conflicts with an account of *akrasia* that Aristotle attributes to Socrates.

4. I will then provide a summary of the account that Aristotle attributes to Socrates, also drawing from Plato’s *Protagoras*, in which Socrates is portrayed as presenting an analogous account. I will then argue that the Socratic account is also found wanting, as Aristotle argues that the Socratic position denies matters evident in experience.

5. I will then present Aristotle’s account of *akrasia*, specifically focusing on his framing of *akrasia* as two competing practical syllogisms, and distinguishing the different ways one is said to “know”. This section will examine interpretively challenging passages to substantiate my reading of his account.

6. I will then provide a critical analysis of Aristotle’s account. Presenting the possible critique that while Aristotle’s account offers a detailed description of the *akratic* agent’s actions, he does not fully elucidate the cause by which the *akratic* agent can know the correct course of action yet fail to act upon it.

7. To address this explanatory gap, I will propose that integrating Gilbert Ryle’s epistemology and Myles Burnyeat’s interpretive framework of Aristotle offers a compelling way to understand how one can possess knowledge of the good without it necessarily translating into action.

8. Ultimately, I will argue that Aristotle’s account of *akrasia* offers significant insight when understood not as attributing the cause to an intellectual error or an overpowering appetite but rather as a deficiency reflecting one’s moral character—a symptom of ethical incompletion. In doing so, I contend that his explanation offers a nuanced, realistic account of moral psychology that integrates cognitive, affective, and developmental elements of ethical life.

## The reputable opinions surrounding *akrasia*   

In Book VII of the *Nicomachean Ethics*, Aristotle examines the phenomenon of *akrasia* and the various puzzles (*aporiai*)—inconsistent conclusions arising from varying reputable opinions (*endoxa*)—that pertain to giving an account of this phenomenon (*NE* VII.1, 1145b2-3). The method of his examination is that of a *dialectical* inquiry which aims to achieve a synthesis that maintains the most principal (*kurion*) beliefs of the varying reputable opinions whilst providing a satisfactory account of the appearances (*phainomena*)—that is, the way *akrasia* seems to manifest in experience (*NE* VII.1, 1145b4-5).

### The appearance (*phainomena*)  

*Akrasia*, often translated as incontinence, is described by Aristotle as a character trait where one is prone to episodes of internal conflict of a particular kind (*NE* VII.1, 1145a15). In such episodes, the *akratic* agent undergoes a process of deliberation and makes a reasoned choice (*prohairesis*), in which they deem a course of action to be the best among available alternatives for the realisation of the ends that they wish for (*boulēsin*) (*NE* III.3, 1112b16, 1113a10). Yet, rather than acting in accordance with their reasoned choice, the *akratic* person acts against their better judgement, seemingly under the influence of a passion (*pathos*) (*NE* VII.1, 1145b12).

### Plato’s account of *akrasia*  
Aristotle’s initial depiction of the phenomenon corresponds to Plato’s depiction and account in the *Republic*.

In Book IV of the *Republic*, Plato, through the voice of Socrates, recounts the story of Leontius as an instantiation of the phenomenon of *akrasia*. Walking past execution grounds, Leontius is described as being torn between his desire to look at the corpses and his moral revulsion. Overcome by his appetite (*epithumia*), he is reported to have cried out in anger against himself, “Look, for yourselves, you evil wretches, take fill of the beautiful sight!” (*Republic* 439e-440a).

Highlighted in this depiction is the internal division within Leontius. Leontius’ rational aversion to the base act, the overpowering impulse of appetite, and anger at his own weakness capture Plato’s account of *akrasia*, that is, the experience of *knowing* what one ought to do yet failing to do it due to a conflict of desires arising from different parts of the tripartite soul—the rational part (*logistikon*), appetitive part (*epithymetikon*), and spirited part (*thymoeides*) respectively (*Republic* 440b). Hence, for Plato, such failure to act according to what the agent has judged to be better is a result of *psychic* conflict—conflict within the *soul*—where the irrational (*alogistos*) *epithymetikon* overpowers reason in the governance of action (*Republic* 440a).

Yet this account gives rise to a puzzle. While psychic conflict might explain why reason fails to govern action in cases of *akrasia*, the account is inconsistent with the reputable opinion that knowledge, being the most authoritative principle in the human soul, cannot be overcome (*Protagoras* 352b-c).

### Socrates’ account of *akrasia* 

Aristotle attributes this **endoxon** to Socrates and reports him as having denied the very possibility of *akrasia* (*NE* VII.2, 1145b25). This position aligns with the argument Socrates is portrayed to give by Plato in the *Protagoras*, in which he argues it is impossible for a person to be unwilling to do what is best when they know what it is and are able to do it (*Protagoras* 352d).

Underlying this position is Socrates’ psychological presupposition that people don’t choose what is bad knowingly (*Protagoras* 358d). All action is guided by what the agent perceives as good at the time of action; hence, moral failure is reinterpreted as a kind of intellectual error (*Protagoras* 358c).

Thus, what appears to be *akrasia* is, on the Socratic account, really a failure of knowledge—either an incomplete understanding or the misidentification of an apparent good for the true good (*Protagoras* 357e; *NE* VII.2, 1145b6-7). His account, therefore, reduces moral failure to intellectual error—what we might call a form of moral *intellectualism* (Burnyeat 1981, p. 70).

However, the Socratic account is also found wanting, as Aristotle argues that the Socratic position denies evident matters. Namely, the incontinent person does not think that they should do what they later actually do (*NE* VII.2 1145b26-7). Indeed, Leontius must, in some sense, know that what he is doing is wrong *at the time of his incontinence* to rebuke himself during the act, as evidenced by his outburst (*Republic* 439e-440a)

### The puzzle (*aporiai*)  

These *endoxa* set the stage for Aristotle’s account, which attempts to avoid both the reductive intellectualism of Socrates and the model of psychic conflict based solely on competing desires found in Plato’s account (Sorabji 2002, p. 310). To achieve a synthesis, Aristotle must address the sense in which one, having judged another course of action as better, can *know* what is right but yet *fail* to act in accordance with that knowledge (*NE* VII.3 1146b9).

## Aristotle’s account of *akrasia*  

Aristotle develops his answer to this question throughout Book VII of the *Nicomachean Ethics*. Two parts central to Aristotle’s account are, first, his framing of *akrasia* as two competing practical syllogisms and, second, his distinction between ways in which one can be said to “know.”

### Two practical syllogisms  

As presented by Aristotle, practical syllogisms are forms of reasoning that yield an action (*NE* VII.3, 1147a27-8). They are comprised of a *universal belief*, which expresses a general principle, and a *particular belief*, known by perception (*aisthēsis*) (*NE* VII.3, 1147a25). When both beliefs are actively held (*NE* VII.3, 1147a3-4) and combined to form a conclusion that implies a specific action, the conclusion is necessarily acted upon immediately, provided there are no hindrances (*NE* VII.3, 1147a25-30).

For instance, if one were to hold the *universal belief* “everything sweet must be tasted” and the *particular belief* “this one particular thing is sweet”, the resulting conclusion “this one particular sweet thing must be tasted” is necessarily acted upon provided there are no hindrances (*NE* VII.3, 1147a30-1).

In cases of *akrasia*, Aristotle posits that two competing practical syllogisms are being constructed.

The first syllogism—what we may call the *good syllogism*—is composed of a universal belief that “hinders one from tasting” (*NE* VII.3, 1147b31-2); this can be termed the *good universal belief* that most commentators reconstruct in the form “one ought not to taste sweet things” (Reeve 2014, p. 293). When this is combined with the *particular belief* “this is sweet” (*NE* VII.3, 1147a33), the syllogism yields the *good conclusion* “Do not taste this.” If the agent is unimpeded, this conclusion would be immediately issued in action—that is, refraining from tasting the sweet thing (*NE* VII.3, 1147b34).

The second syllogism—what we may call the *bad syllogism*—is composed of the *bad universal belief* “all sweet things are pleasant” (*NE* VII.3, 1147a32-3) and the same *particular belief* shared with the good syllogism “this is sweet” that combine to yield the conclusion “taste this,” which for the *akratic* ends up being the action taken rather than the conclusion of the good syllogism. 

In this analysis, Aristotle seems to posit that what enables both the *bad syllogism* and *good syllogism* to be constructed is that when the particular belief—“this is sweet”—shared by both lines of reasoning becomes active, this in turn simultaneously activates both the *good universal belief*—chosen (*prohairesis*) by deliberation (*NE* VII.4, 1148a9)—and the *bad universal belief*—supplied by one’s appetite (NE III.2, 1111b13-14)—to compete to latch onto the particular belief. Hence, one’s choice (*prohairesis*) *pulls* one from the action, whereas one’s appetite *drives* one towards it, as each part of the soul is capable of initiating motion (*NE* VII.3, 1147a34-5). 

This interpretation of Aristotle’s account of *akrasia* in Book VII is supported by his earlier discussion in Book III. There, Aristotle states that the *akratic* person acts on appetite, which concerns pleasure and pain, whereas the *enkratic* (self-controlled) person acts on choice (*prohairesis*), which is the result of deliberation (*NE* III.1, 1111b13-4). Furthermore, Aristotle has already acknowledged the possibility of internal conflict, stating that the desires of the rational and non-rational parts of the soul may oppose each other, as they do in the *akratic* person (*NE* I.13, 1102b15-20).


### Clarifying “reason and belief”  
Continuing, Aristotle states that, in a way, it is “reason and belief” that cause *akrasia* (*NE* VII.4, 1147b1). I interpret this to mean that, without reason—meaning the *good universal belief*—there would be no conflict, and one would behave like the intemperate person, acting in accordance with appetite without resistance (*NE* VII.3, 1147a20-25). Additionally, it is a belief—specifically, the *particular belief*—that is shared between both syllogisms and plays a pivotal role in *akratic* action. The *particular belief*—“this is sweet”—activates the appetite, thereby contributing to the bad syllogism’s formation.

Thus, in this reading, Aristotle’s terse reference to “reason and belief” can be taken to mean the *good universal belief* and the *particular belief*, respectively. This interpretation coheres with both the preceding account and the following lines, which indicate that the *particular belief* is not intrinsically opposed to the *good universal belief* since it is also what activates it (*NE* VII.4, 1147b2). The opposition arises only incidentally when the *particular belief*, connecting with the appetite, contributes to the *bad syllogism* being formed (*NE* VII.4, 1147b3).

### Preserving the Socratic thesis  

At this stage, Aristotle’s account may not seem to answer the Socratic puzzle:  namely, how someone can know what is best yet fail to act accordingly. However, he directly addresses this question in the subsequent section of VII.3, offering a response that has provoked much debate among commentators (Reeve 2014, p. 293). In this passage, Aristotle attempts to pinpoint which proposition in the practical syllogism the *akratic* person fails to grasp or only grasps in a deficient way, like a drunk person or a student merely repeating words without understanding (*NE* VII.3, 1147b12). He identifies this proposition as the *teleutaia protasis* (the “last premise”), which governs action, is tied to perception, and is not universal (*NE* VII.3, 1147b9-10, 1147b13-14).

However, there is ambiguity as to whether this refers to the *particular* *belief* or the *conclusion* of the good syllogism (Reeve 2014, pp. 293-4). I argue that Aristotle is referring to the latter. If the *akratic* person were truly ignorant of the *particular premise*, such as “this is sweet”, then they could not have formed the bad syllogism that leads to *akratic* action. Nor could the *akratic* agent have formed the good conclusion, even in a limited sense, which cannot account for how those like Leontius seem to express knowledge of the good conclusion during their *akratic* action (*Republic* 439e-440a). Thus, it seems probable to read Aristotle’s view as locating *akrasia* not in the ignorance of a premise, but in the failure to *effectively possess the conclusion* of the good syllogism. 

Importantly, this conclusion concerns a particular—one’s actions—and thus is *perceptual knowledge* and is not directly an instance of scientific knowledge (*epistēmē*) which concerns universals (*NE* VII.4, 1147b15-7). In this way, Aristotle preserves the core of the Socratic claim: *epistēmē* is never truly overcome. *Akrasia*, then, is not a failure of universal knowledge but a failure in applying that knowledge to particulars—specifically, in failing to actualise the good conclusion such that it yields an action.

## Analysis  

Although Aristotle offers a nuanced psychological description of the *akratic* agent’s actions, his account still leaves us with a critical explanatory gap. While he outlines the conflict between the competing *universal beliefs* that stem from one’s choice (*prohairesis*) and appetite, he does not fully explain *why* the appetite is acted on rather than one’s *prohairesis*. Unless this is explained, Aristotle’s account risks possessing a flaw present in Plato’s: identifying the conflict between rational and irrational desires without explaining why reason loses. Simply stating that the agent fails to use their knowledge is not a satisfying explanation. We need an account of *how* and *why* the *akratic* person knows the correct practical conclusion, but only in a way that fails to issue in action.

To address this, I argue we can turn to Gilbert Ryle’s epistemological distinction between *knowing how* and *knowing that* (Ryle 1945). In his paper *Knowing How and Knowing That*, Ryle argues that knowledge is not exhausted by the possession of propositional truths (*knowing that*) but also includes a dispositional and embodied capacity to act appropriately in context (*knowing how*) (Ryle 1945, pp. 4-6). For instance, someone may know all the propositions regarding riding a bicycle (*knowing that*), but this propositional knowledge, even one’s active contemplation of the relevant proposition for the given scenario, is insufficient for actually riding a bike—one must possess a *knowing how* to apply and act on that knowledge in practice (Ryle 1945, pp. 6-7). 

Applying this distinction to Aristotle’s account of *akrasia* offers a fruitful insight. The *akratic* person may know that they ought not to perform a certain action (i.e., they have the good universal belief and can even formulate the good conclusion), but they lack the *knowing how* necessary to enact that conclusion. Their failure is not intellectual in the strict Socratic sense of lacking knowledge of the good, but rather practical—they have not developed the stable dispositions (*hexeis*) and character (*êthos*) necessary to act on this knowledge consistently (*NE* II.1, 1103a17-8, 1103b22-3; Ryle 1945, p. 15).

Myles Burnyeat offers a complementary view in his essay “Aristotle on Learning to be Good”. He distinguishes between knowing *the that* (that something is the case) and knowing *the because* (why it is the case) (*NE* I.4, 1095b2-13), similarly arguing that Aristotle is pointing to a form of moral understanding that is not reducible to propositional rules (Burnyeat 1981, p. 72). Rather, he identifies knowing *the because* as one’s reasoned conception of the good, which acts as a guiding evaluative attitude (Burnyeat 1981, p. 72).

In this light, *akrasia* arises when the agent does not yet have an internalised evaluative attitude of ethical reasoning. Hence, their knowledge remains external, abstract—knowing *the that*—but has not been integrated as a motivational *principle* (i.e., nature) of their being, so they often fail to act according to it (Burnyeat 1981, p. 85-8).

This interpretation aligns with Aristotle’s broader ethical framework, in which the development of virtue is essential to moral action. The *enkratic* (self-controlled) person may act in accordance with the good conclusion despite contrary desires, but only the *virtuous* person has harmonised their rational and non-rational parts such that no internal conflict arises (Burnyeat 1981, p. 85). Thus, Burnyeat’s interpretation of understanding *akrasia* as involving one’s lack of knowing *the because* allows for a coherent reading of why Aristotle introduces *akrasia* not just as a failure of reason but as a *character trait* (*NE* VII.1, 1145a15). 

To return to our earlier analogy, just as someone learning to ride a bike may know all the possible propositions involved in riding a bike but still fall when attempting a turn, the *akratic* person may identify the right action yet fail to perform it due to a deficiency in *character* and *habituation*—an *ethical* limitation (cf. *NE* III.5, 1114a15-22). Their rational part discerns the good, but their motivational structure, shaped by past actions and desires, is not yet responsive to that knowledge (*NE* I.3, 1095a2-11). Hence, Aristotle observes in *NE* X.9 that one must be guided in action so that, by doing what is noble and just, one comes to recognise its truth for oneself (*NE* X.9, 1179b4-31). Thus, much like the youth who are not yet good judges because they lack life experience (*NE* I.3, 1095a2-11), the *akratic* person has not yet gained experience in his own life such that he knows *the because* or the *knowing how*. Their knowledge of the good has not yet become second nature—an internal principle of action. Aristotle makes this point explicitly,

> The fact that they talk the talk that stems from scientific knowledge signifies nothing, since those in the grip of their feelings can recite demonstrations and verses of Empedocles. And those who have first learned something string the words together but do not yet know what they have learned, since it must grow to be a natural part of them, and that takes time. So we must suppose that those who are acting without self-control are also talking like actors on a stage 

> (*NE* VII.3, 1147a21–22).

Thus, Aristotle’s account, supplemented by Ryle’s epistemology and Burnyeat’s interpretive framework, allows us to make sense of how one can know the good and yet fail to act accordingly. *Akrasia* is not simply a matter of intellectual error but can be explained as a symptom of moral incompletion—a sign that one’s rational insight has outpaced their character formation.
