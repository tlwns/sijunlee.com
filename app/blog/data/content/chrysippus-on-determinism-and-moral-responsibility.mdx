## Introduction  

In this essay, I will critically analyse the Stoic account of the compatibility of determinism and moral responsibility, with particular focus on Chrysippus’ compatibilist account as it is presented in Cicero’s *On Fate* and Gellius’ *Attic Nights*. 
 
The structure of my analysis will be as follows:

1. I will begin by contextualising Stoicism as a systematic philosophy, in which we expect coherence between the Stoic account of determinism and of moral responsibility.

2. I will provide a summary of the Stoic account regarding moral responsibility, namely, as centering on one’s use of assent.

3. I will then present a critique that questions the internal coherence of Stoic doctrines of determinism and moral psychology in giving an account of moral responsibility, as recorded by Cicero and Gellius in *On Fate* and *Attic Nights*, respectively.

4. I will then present Chrysippus’ response, which is recorded alongside the critiques, that answers them by specifying the moral agent’s individual nature as the determining causal factor of one’s assent.

5. I will raise the concern that this account produces the same question regarding moral responsibility in respect to the agent’s individual nature being externally caused, which seems to imply that one’s acts of assent are also determined by external causes.

6. I will then address the concern raised in (5) by arguing that the interposition of assent is sufficient for moral responsibility, and the individual nature being externally caused does not mean one’s assent and hence their actions are caused externally by way of transitivity.

7. I will then argue that our intuitive sense that moral appraisal is only just if everyone starts moral development from the same initial conditions is a presupposition not shared by ancient Stoics. Rather, the Stoics focus on accepting one’s lot, as even one’s individual nature is given by Fate.

## Stoicism as a Systematic Philosophy 

The ancient Stoics conceived of their philosophy as a coherent system, in which each doctrine both supports and is supported by one another to form a unified body of knowledge (Cicero, *On Moral Ends* 3.74).   

This systematic character is reflected in that although the Stoics divided their philosophy into three constituent parts—physics (*phusikê*), logic (*logikê*), and ethics (*êthikê*)—they held that no part is isolated from another but rather that they blend (*memíchthai*) together (DL, *Lives* 7.40), and facilitate a comprehensive grasp of wisdom (*sophia*) (Seneca, *Letters* 89.1). 
 
Diogenes Laertius famously reports the various analogies used by the Stoics to illustrate this holistic view of philosophy. Namely, philosophy is likened to an egg, with logic corresponding to the shell, ethics to the white, and physics to the yolk (DL, *Lives* 7.40). 
 
Given this systematic nature, we should expect coherence between the Stoic account of determinism and their account of moral responsibility.

## Stoic Moral Psychology  

The Stoic account of moral responsibility, as centering on one’s use of assent (*sunkatathesis*), is found within the school’s psychology: account of the soul (*psuchê*). 
 
Stoic psychology develops the Socratic view of the soul found in Plato’s earlier dialogues, namely, the *Protagoras*, which presents the adult human soul as an entirely rational whole (*Protagoras* 352d; Frede 2012, p. 32). 
 
However, the Stoics maintain that the human soul is not rational from its outset. Human children are said to possess a non-rational soul which transforms into a rational soul later in life upon becoming an adult (Frede 2012, p. 35). Until then, in its pre-rational stage, the human’s psychological life resembles that of other non-rational animals and, like them, holds no moral responsibility (Seneca, *Letters* 124.8-10, 17-9; Galen 5.1.10=TSR 159; Frede 2012 p. 35) 
 
Before acquiring reason, humans act on impressions (*phantasia*) in the same way as other non-rational animals, guided by a sense of one’s constitution which generates impulses (*hormaí*) toward what is appropriate (*kathêkon*) for their nature, but without the reflective judgement required for moral appraisal (DL, *Lives* 7.85-6; Inwood 1985, p. 47). 
 
What is lacking in the psychology of non-rational animals and pre-rational children for the attribution of moral responsibility is the capacity of assent (*sunkatathesis*)—which in turn requires reason (Seneca, *Letters* 124.20; Inwood 1985, p. 42). The acquisition of reason occurs when the human soul develops sufficient preconceptions (*prolēpseis*)—general notions derived from repeated experience—which provide the conceptual framework for evaluating impressions (Aëtius 4.11.1-5=TSR 21). This coincides with the attainment of a linguistic capacity to form “sayables” (*lekta*), which specify relations between objects or events in the world and enable one to construe inferences from those relations (Gill 2006, p. 140). With the acquisition of reason, coinciding with the aforementioned linguistic capacity, impressions now contain “assertibles” (*axiōmata*)—propositional content composed of *lekta*—which allows the agent to assent—make a truth-apt evaluation—regarding its content, being informed by their conceptions (Sextus Empiricus *M* 8.70=TSR 49; Inwood 1985, p. 55). 
 
Thus, in the adult human, assent interposes impression and impulse. One’s impression gives rise to an impulse (*hormê*)—and thus to action—only when the agent assents to it, judging its propositional content as good or bad for oneself (Gill 2006, p. 140). For example, suppose an individual sees their neighbour’s expensive lamp left unattended. The sight produces within them the impression, “I could take that lamp.” This impression alone does not compel action. It becomes an impulse toward theft only once the individual assents to the propositional content, accepting that taking the lamp would be good for them. If instead you withhold assent, judging the action bad or inappropriate, the impression does not give rise to an impulse, and the theft would not occur.

## Stoic Determinism  

The Stoic theory of determinism can be understood in terms of their theory of causation and theory of Fate. 
 
Central to the Stoic theory of determinism are two claims regarding causation. Firstly, that no motion or state is without a cause (Plutarch, *On Stoic Self-Contradictions* 1050d=TSR 93; Sextus Empiricus, *M* 9.75=TSR 33; Bobzien 1999, p. 22). Secondly, that effects are fully determined by their causes: such that the same causes produce the same effects (Plutarch, *On Stoic Self-Contradictions* 1045c=TSR 93; Bobzien 1999, p. 40-1). From these, it follows that the world at any time possesses a total causal configuration that determines what will obtain thereafter; iterating this yields a continuous nexus of antecedent causes linking all past, present, and future motions and states (Bobzien 1999, pp. 71-4). 
 
This determinism at the cosmic level was seen as the work of a rational principle. The Stoics identified this rational principle as “Fate” (*heimarmenē*)—or equivalently “Zeus”, “Nature”, and various other names—and saw the causal nexus of the cosmos as one that is rationally ordered according to the providential will of this divine being (Cleanthes, *Hymn to Zeus*=TSR 28; DL, *Lives* 7.88). 
 
However, the nexus of antecedent causes linking all past, present, and future motions and states of the cosmos would include those of human psychology and actions. Such that any motion and state of the soul, and hence the actions that it impels, would ultimately be determined by external antecedent causes. This then raises the question, how might an individual be held morally responsible for their actions, when they are brought about by antecedent causes that are not in one’s power?

## The Problem of Determinism  

Critiques that question the internal coherence of Stoic determinism and moral psychology, specifically in giving an account of moral responsibility, are recorded by Cicero and Gellius in their works *On Fate* and *Attic Nights* (Cicero, *On Fate* 39-45; Gellius, *Attic Nights* 7.2). 
 
Both authors present a version of a general argument that can be summarised as such :

(P1).   If all things that occur come about by fate, then all things have an antecedent cause.

(P2).   Antecedent causes fully determine their effects.

(P3).   From (P1): therefore, every impression has an antecedent cause.

(P4).   Antecedent causation is transitive: if X is an antecedent cause of Y and Y is an antecedent cause of Z, then X is an antecedent cause of Z.

(P5).   The antecedent cause of an impression is not located in us.

(P6).   If X has its ultimate antecedent cause in something not in us, then X itself does not depend on us.

(P7).   From (P3), (P5), (P6): impressions do not depend on us.

(P8).   Whatever follows from an impression stands to that impression as an effect to cause; by (P4), its antecedent cause is the antecedent cause of the impression, which by (P5) is not in us. Therefore, all things that follow from an impression do not depend on us.

(P9).   Assents and their resultant actions are among the things that follow from impressions.

(P10).   Therefore, neither our assents nor our actions depend on us; hence, it is not just to praise or blame, honour or punish, for such things.

Thus, the proponents of this argument assert that Stoic accounts of determinism and moral psychology combined yield a paradox in regards to giving an account of moral responsibility. Hence, if the argument holds, the Stoic can only hold either that all things are fated or that one is responsible for one’s actions, but not both.

## Chrysippus’ Compatibilism   

### Auxiliary vs Principal causes 

We learn from the record in Cicero that Chrysippus proceeds to object to the argument introduced in the previous section by introducing a distinction among causes. 
 
Chrysippus contrasts causes he calls “auxiliary and proximate” with those he calls “perfect and principal” (Cicero, *On Fate* 41). Perfect and principal causes fully determine their effects, whilst auxiliary and proximate causes do not (Bobzien 1999, p. 257). Following this, he specifies that while all things do have an antecedent cause, not all antecedent causes are principal and primary (Cicero, *On Fate* 41). 
 
Applying this to human psychology, he argues that the antecedent cause of one’s assent—one’s impressions—are only proximate and auxiliary, whereas the perfect and principal cause, that fully determines one’s assent, is their own individual nature, which is internal to oneself (Cicero, *On Fate* 42).

### Cylinder and Cone Analogy  

To illustrate this notion, Chrysippus uses the analogy of a cylinder and a cone being pushed down a slope (Cicero, *On Fate* 42). 
 
Although neither object would begin to move prior the auxiliary and proximate cause of being pushed, it is the individual nature of the shape—its form—that acts as the perfect and principal cause which determines the quality of the effect, that is, the cylinder rolling and the cone turning (Cicero, *On Fate* 42). 
 
Analogously, one’s impressions only act as the trigger for the motion that is our use of assent. The principal cause that determines this assent is the individual nature of the agent—that is, chiefly, their moral character (Cicero, *On Fate* 43; Gellius, *Attic Nights* 7.2.11).

### Character as the Perfect Cause of Action   

Salient within this analogy is the idea that in the determination of human action, Fate works through the character of humans, via their dispositions and beliefs; hence, Fate does not externally force human beings to act in certain ways (Gellius *Attic Nights* 7.2.7; Bobzien 1999, p. 253). Chrysippus illustrates this by suggesting that, if two individuals, one virtuous and one vicious, were placed by Fate in a scenario with equal external causal configurations, the virtuous individual would act virtuously and the vicious individual would act viciously—each reflecting who they are (Gellius *Attic Nights* 7.2.8-9; Frede 2012, p. 81). 
 
Therefore, since the perfect and principal cause that determines an agent’s assent lies in their own nature and is thus reflective of who they are, praise and blame are rightly attached to the agent for all actions that proceed from their use of assent (Gellius, *Attic Nights* 7.2.13; Bobzien 1999, p. 254). 
 
In closing, Gellius reports that Chrysippus adduces a quote from Homer as encapsulating his thesis:

>“It makes me furious—how mortals blame the gods! They say that their troubles come from us; but they incur pains on their own beyond their allotment because of their wickedness.” 
 
>(Homer, *Odyssey* 1.32–34, as cited in Gellius, *Attic Nights* 7.2.14)

## Determination of Character 

As we have seen, Chrysippus’ compatibilist account secures moral responsibility by specifying the agent’s individual nature as the determining cause of their assent. However, if a person’s nature is itself the outcome of antecedent causes, this account seems to merely relocate the problem. 
 
However, I argue that according to Chrysippus’ account of moral responsibility, it is clear that this critique does not hold. As Chrysippus does not hold any notion supporting the transitivity of determining factors, but regards the *interposition of assent* as a sufficient condition in regard to attributing moral responsibility (Cicero, *On Fate* 40-3). 
 
That is to say, when a rational agent assents—or withholds assent—to the content of an impression, that assent is the perfect and principal cause of the ensuing impulse and action (Cicero, *On Fate* 43). Therefore, the earlier, external causal factors that shaped the agent’s current individual nature function only as auxiliary background conditions. 
 
Thus, even if one’s individual nature has been formed by antecedent external causes, this does not make one’s present assent—and so one’s action—an externally caused by way of transitivity. That is to say, external causes may determine individual natures without thereby determining action. However, we still seem to retain an intuitive aversion to the thought that individual natures are externally caused, and furthermore to the thought that it has *some* role in shaping our moral status. 
 
This concern is perpetuated by the fact, that although the Stoics seem to have held that moral qualities are not inherited (DL, *Lives* 7.89), Chrysippus affirms that differences in people’s natures are due to the causes that bring them about, and also that children do *resemble* their parents in regards to habits and character which in turn affects one’s moral qualities (Gellius, *Attic Nights*. 7.2.7-8; Bobzien 1999, p. 292-3). 
 
But despite our concerns, Susanne Bobzien reports that there are no signs that Chrysippus addresses this seemly obvious critique or is troubled by it (Bobzien 1999, p. 291). Thus, for the modern reader, this leaves the looming question of *why*? 
 
To address this, I argue—drawing from Bobzien’s response to this question—that Chrysippus’ compatibilism aims only to establish that the determining cause and moral responsibility for an action is located internally within the agent and not in the external world. Furthermore, I argue that our unease with our individual natures being externally caused stems from our sense that moral appraisal is only just if everyone starts with the same initial conditions. 
 
That is to say, it seems wrong to us to praise those afforded a good upbringing or to blame those burdened with a poor one, as though a head-start or natural propensity to virtue makes moral appraisal unjust. But I argue that the Stoics do not share this presupposition. Hence, their account of determinism and moral responsibility retains its coherence. The Stoic ethical project seems to be framed not around equalising starting points but around making moral and cognitive progress (*prokopê*) at each stage of moral development (Epictetus, *Discourses* 1.4). Hence, Stoics emphasise moral education and training (*askēsis*) that refine one’s dispositions and help shape good preconceptions (Epictetus, *Discourses* 1.2.7; 3.2; Inwood 1985, pp. 68-9). 
 
In this picture, blame and punishment, as well as praise and honour, do not require equal moral initial conditions. Rather, they attach to the fact that the agent is a rational human being who is acting as a result of rational judgments. 
 
This stance also explains why the Stoics are untroubled by claims regarding the extreme rarity of sagehood (Seneca, *Letters* 42.1-2). The point of appraisal is not to guarantee universal attainability of perfect virtue, but to track the quality of rational activity—how one’s assents align with reason and Nature—and its progress. 
 
The often cited “dog and cart” image captures the normative attitude one should take. As the cart of fate rolls on, the wise “dog” moves willingly with it, while the foolish resist but are dragged along all the same (Hippolytus, *Refutation of All Heresies* 1.21=TSR 99). The lesson seems to be that one should accept all that Zeus has allotted—including one’s starting character—and focus on aligning one’s use of assent to be in accordance with nature, within a providential order that is, for the Stoic, the best possible arrangement of things. 
 
In this light, our concern seems to be misplaced. As Bobzien notes, we readily accept unequal starting points in other domains such as health, musicality, and beauty, without thereby denying praise, blame, encouragement, and correction (Bobzien 1999, p. 299). Why should ethics alone require equal starting points? A Stoic can instead urge that we pity those less favoured, congratulate those more fortunate, and devote ourselves to as much moral progress as we can achieve.
