## Introduction

In this essay, I will critically evaluate Stoicism as a way-of-life philosophy.

The structure of my evaluation will be as follows:

1. I will provide an analysis of what ‘philosophy as a way of life’ means, drawing upon ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophical traditions. I will argue that these traditions emphasise the psychagogic and transformative role of philosophy in guiding one’s actions, character, and pursuit of the good life. This will provide a framework for evaluating Stoicism and its doctrinal commitments and practical application in comparison to the philosophy of Socrates, with a focus on their efficacy as lived philosophies.

2. I will then provide an outline of the key Stoic doctrines that shape the Stoic way of life, drawing on the teachings of Epictetus, Seneca, Cicero, and the foundational philosophy of Zeno as recorded by Diogenes Laertius.

3. I will also provide a summary of the philosophy of Socrates as presented in Plato’s *Apology*, specifically focusing on the ‘Socratic method’ as a practical exercise that characterises the Socratic way of life.

4. I will then provide a comparative analysis. Presenting the possible critique regarding Stoicism’s doctrinal commitments—such as its doctrine of God and providence—which may limit its practical efficacy for those who find these underpinnings unconvincing.

5. Ultimately, I argue that whilst the therapeutic benefits of Stoicism are not exclusive to those who accept the entire doctrinal corpus, an acceptance of only select doctrines may diminish the efficacy that the Stoic way of life offers.

## The Art of Living: Philosophy in Ancient Greek and Roman traditions

In the ancient Greek and following Hellenistic periods philosophy was not merely an intellectual pursuit, but mainly a psychagogic pursuit (cf. Hadot 2017, p.19-22), ultimately aimed at guiding the individual’s soul towards the highest human good which they identified as *eudaimonia*, human flourishing.

This psychagogic role of philosophy is explicated by the ancient philosophers themselves. In Plato’s *Apology*, Socrates likens himself to a gadfly, whose purpose is to rouse the Athenians who are solely pursuing conditional goods such as wealth, reputation, and honour, and instead spur them to practice a life of virtue (*arete*), which he identifies as the pursuit of “truth and wisdom” and “the best possible state” of one’s soul (Plato, *Apology* 29e-30e).

Similarly, Epictetus identifies philosophy as ‘the art of living’ which has each individual’s own life as its proper subject matter (Epictetus, *Discourses* I.15.2). Epictetus goes as far as to condemn those that do not make any practical application of the treatises they pride themselves in knowing (Epictetus, *Discourses* II.9.13). He likens them to those who store away bread and wine but do not eat it, merely possessing but not benefiting (Epictetus, *Discourses* II.9.18).

It is within this understanding of philosophy, as a certain choice of life in which one is in sympathy with the doctrines of the school they have chosen (Epictetus, *Discourses* II.9.20-21), that I wish to assess the viability of assuming the Stoic frame of mind and its efficacy in treating the existential afflictions of the human condition.

## Stoicism

### Internals and Externals

The foundational doctrine and exercise of the Stoic way of life consists of distinguishing between internals—things that are ‘up to us’—and externals—things that are not ‘up to us’.

Epictetus’ *Discourses*, recorded by his student Arrian, begins with this key distinction (Epictetus, *Discourses* I.1). At the heart of this distinction lies Epictetus’ assertion—shared by all Stoics—that the only thing placed absolutely within our power by Nature against all hindrance and compulsion—the only true ‘internal’—is our capacity to make use of our impressions via acts of assent, namely, our power of choice (*prohairesis*) (Epictetus, *Discourses* I.1.7, I.1.23). By contrast, everything beyond *prohairesis*, such as our body and property, are external, not free from hindrance and compulsion, and are not truly ‘up to us’ (Epictetus, *Discourses* I.1.10, IV.1.129-30).

The lived implication of this distinction is twofold. Firstly, since our power of choice is the only true ‘internal’, and a distinct characteristic of us as rational creatures, it defines our very essence as human beings (Epictetus, *Discourses* 3.1.40). Consequently, the good human life (*eudaimonia*), understood teleologically, consists in the *excellent* use of this capacity—that is, in a manner that displays virtue (*arete*) (Epictetus, *Discourses* 1.8.16, 1.28.21, 2.5.4-5). Secondly, since the human good lies solely in one’s use of choice, all other things lack intrinsic value and are considered indifferent (*adiaphora*), meaning they are neither good nor bad. While some indifferents are *preferable* (Epictetus, *Discourses* II.5.24), this foundational distinction ultimately has the *practical* aim of honing a sense of rectitude that keeps us from evaluating our external state as having any stake in constituting our *happiness*.

### Nature and Providence

To understand the role of oneself and of the externals in life, the Stoics appeal to their doctrine of Nature and divine providence, which frame the cosmos as a rational and ordered whole.

The Stoics believed that the world was providentially ordered by an intelligent and rational divine power (Epictetus, *Discourses* 1.6.1–11). They referred to this divine force by various names, including Nature, God, and Zeus, envisioning it as a material presence that seamlessly blends and permeates throughout the entire cosmos (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives* 7.88).

Adopting this frame of mind yields a therapeutic effect: one achieves tranquility (*ataraxia*), unhindered by external circumstances, and free from future anxieties, whilst remaining hopeful in a greater providential purpose that ultimately serves our good (Epictetus, *Discourses* 1.24.1–2). This outlook, in turn, empowers one to exclusively apply themselves to living in the present and perfecting one’s use of will (*prohairesis*)—the true source of our happiness (Epictetus, *Discourses* 1.12.7–9)

Additionally, the Stoics maintained that Nature endows each one of us with an innate awareness of and affinity (*oikeiôsis*) to one’s constitution and proper character (*prosōpon*)—a normative self-conception of who we ought to be (Cicero, *On Duties* 1.107-15; Epictetus, *Discourses* I.2.30). This self-conception guides our use of *prohairesis*, informing us to assent to select impressions that give rise to actions that are appropriate (*kathēkon*) to our character (Cicero, *On Duties* 1.110; Epictetus, *Discourses* I.2.7, IV.12.15–18; Seneca, *Letter* 121.3,14). Furthermore, this awareness also carries an inherently other-regarding dimension; as we refine our capacity for reason, we come to see ourselves as integral members of a rational community—one naturally designed to mutually enhance our well-being (Cicero, *Moral Ends* 3.62–69). 

The lived effect of this doctrine is that it comforts us by giving us a sense of purpose within the cosmic system, an assurance that we are not *thrown* into existence without any normative guidance or teleological purpose, “condemned to be free” as the existentialist philosophers claim (Sartre 2000, p.67-71). But by aligning our *individual nature* with the rational order of the cosmos, we are invited to exercise our will in a purposeful manner that cultivates personal virtue and contributes to the common good of all rational beings (Cicero, *Moral Ends* 3.64).

## The Socratic Way of Life

The Socratic way of life, in contrast to the more doctrine-heavy Stoic approach, is characterised by a practice of self-examination and critical inquiry, known as the ‘Socratic method’.

This way of life is presented most paradigmatically in Plato’s *Apology*, which records the trial of Socrates. In the dialogue, Socrates defends himself against the charges of corrupting the young men of Athens, by teaching them sophistry, and impiety for not believing in the gods of the city (Plato, *Apology* 19b, 24b).

Central to his defence is an unwavering commitment to the philosophical life, a life dedicated to the psychagogic aim of directing one’s soul—and the souls of others—towards a life of virtue (*arete*) (Plato, *Apology* 30b). Even after being condemned to death, Socrates proclaims, “The unexamined life is not worth living” (Plato, *Apology* 38a), underscoring that we are all called to reflect on our beliefs, scrutinise what we know and do not know, and ultimately strive for *wisdom* (*sophia*) instead of transient pleasures such as wealth and honour, which, in the final analysis, only harm the individual (Plato, *Apology* 29e-30e, 39d-e).

The therapeutic effect of the Socratic way of life in practice is a form of mental catharsis. It encourages us to scrutinise our thoughts and current way of life, fostering a state of intellectual humility and an awareness of our own ignorance (Plato, *Apology* 21d). By rigorously questioning what we accept as true, we learn to discern between superficial pleasures and lasting wisdom. Ultimately, the Socratic way of life promises a kind of freedom: freedom from the ensnarement of uncritical convention and the transient lures of wealth, reputation, or honour, and, perhaps most importantly, freedom from the fear of death (Plato, *Apology* 29a). It is a pathway that nurtures the moral and intellectual dimensions of our character thereby engendering a virtuous character that is synonymous with human flourishing (*eudaimonia*)—the greatest human good (Plato, *Apology* 38a; *Gorgias* 507a-c).

## Analysis & Critique

A central point of comparison between Stoicism and the Socratic way of life is the extent to which each demands doctrinal commitment.

The Socratic method is rooted in a commitment to self-examination and critical inquiry without an elaborate systematic doctrine. In contrast, Stoicism is underpinned by a detailed physical theory that includes doctrines regarding internals versus externals, divine providence, and an immanent material God. One might ask whether such systematic commitments—while offering a robust theoretical foundation that is conducive to practical action if one is to be convinced—risk alienating those who find some doctrines less persuasive as a practical guide to life.

Critics may argue that the Stoic reliance on notions like divine providence and cosmic diety can be unconvincing, especially to the modern audience who largely hold a mechanistic view of nature. For some, the idea that all external events are predetermined and that only the power of choice (*prohairesis*) is truly free may seem overly deterministic or even fatalistic, potentially diminishing the role of personal agency. Moreover, the insistence on an elaborate cosmology and indifference towards our external conditions might appear abstract or remote from the everyday experiences of individuals who seek tangible guidance for their lives.

However, proponents of Stoicism may contend that these doctrines are not meant to be dogmatic but are instead integral to the practical exercise of ethics and self-control. The Stoic framework—by distinguishing between what is and is not within our control—directly informs the regulation of our emotions and actions, ultimately leading to states of *ataraxia* (imperturbability) and *eudaimonia* (human flourishing). For example, Epictetus’ emphasis on the power of choice (*prohairesis*) serves as a powerful tool for achieving mental resilience and personal freedom, even if one remains agnostic regarding Stoic physical theory.

I argue that adopting a philosophical way of life does not require one to accept every theoretical nuance; rather, it is the adopting of attitude that matters most centrally (Hadot 2017, p. 283). As Marcus Aurelius notes, whether or not the cosmos is governed by reason, one should strive to act in accordance with reason as it is beneficial to oneself (Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* 6.44). This suggests that the ethical practices and psychological insights of Stoicism can be embraced for their practical benefits, independent of ones full acceptance of its doctrines of physics.

However, I believe adhering to only select doctrinal commitments—without embracing the full breadth of Stoic thought—may lead to diminished efficacy in practice. By neglecting the comprehensive integration of Stoic ethics, physics, logic, and psychology, one risks adopting an incomplete version of the philosophy. Such a partial adoption fails to capture the interconnected nature and full therapeutic benefit of the Stoic way of life, where each doctrinal component reinforces the others in guiding one’s emotions, actions, and understanding of one’s place in the cosmos.
